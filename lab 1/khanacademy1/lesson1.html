    <h1>This Is The Life</h1>
    
    <p>Oh the wind whistles down<br>
        The cold dark street tonight<br>
        And the people they were dancing<br>
        To the music vibe<br>
        <br>
        And the boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair<br>
        While the shocked too many sit way over there<br>
        And the songs get louder each one better than before<br>
        <br>
        And you singing the song thinking this is the life<br>
        And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size<br>
        where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?<br>
        And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the sizxe<br>
        Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?<br>
        Where you gonna sleep tonight<br>
        </p>

            Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. 
            Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. 
            <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
            There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            <em>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</em><br>
            Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. learning.<br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, yet.
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
            
            <em>You only have to know one thing:<br>
            <strong>You can learn anything.</strong></em>
